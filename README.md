# Image-Classification-CNN-Models
This repository contains a series of convolutional neural network (CNN) models for image classification. The project demonstrates techniques such as reducing the learning rate and applying data augmentation to improve model performance on a multi-class classification task. The models are implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.
